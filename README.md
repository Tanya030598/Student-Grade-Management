PROJECT TITLE: **Student-Grade-Management**

DESCRIPTION: Input student details name, enter grades for each student across different subjects or exams. Calculate final grades based on individual subject                         
             grades and any weighted criteria. Generate printable reports for student performance, including average grades and performance analysis.

PURPOSE: The Student Grade Management System is a Python-based application designed to manage and track student grades. It helps teachers or administrators input, store, and calculate students' grades across different subjects, allowing for easy access to academic progress.

TECHNICAL SKILLS: **Python Programming:** Proficiency in Python for writing the core logic of the system, such as functions, loops, conditionals, and data handling.
                  **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Using classes and objects to model different entities like orders, menu items, inventory, and customers.
                  **File Handling:** For saving and retrieving data, storing data in text files or CSV format.
                  **Data Structures:** Understanding and applying data structures like dictionaries for managing orders, menu items, and inventory.
                  **Basic Math and Arithmetic Operations:** Calculating prices, taxes for customer orders and generating accurate bills.

RESULT: The result of the project is a working Student-Grade-Management System that:

Simplifies the process of managing student grades and academic data.
Allows teachers or administrators to easily input and track student performance.
Automates the calculation of final grades and generates reports.
Improves efficiency by storing data in a structured way, reducing the risk of human errors.
The system will streamline the grading process, making it easier for educators to focus on other aspects of teaching while keeping track of students' academic progress efficiently.
